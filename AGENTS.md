# CodeLeWM Agent Context

This repository is a spec-driven research artifact for learning latent
transition models over Python code edits. Treat the spec corpus, RFCs, GitHub
issues, roadmap docs, and benchmark evidence as the contract before making code
changes.

## Current State

As of 2026-05-20, CodeLeWM has a working package runtime, a reproducible local
first-results smoke loop, and one completed scaled Hugging Face Jobs run.

Implemented foundations:

- `codelewm.data`: source adapters, filtering, license decisions, split and
  dedup policy, CodeState extraction, action extraction, staging and pack
  helpers, dataset manifests, and a public CommitPackFT Python shard config.
- `codelewm.model`: transition interfaces, action encoders, predictor modules,
  transition energy, objective helpers, retrieval-loss gate, checkpoint
  compatibility manifests, and checkpoint trust gates.
- `codelewm.training`: manifest-backed training runner, resume compatibility,
  default and scaled configs, CPU smoke executor, and a package-native torch
  executor over packed CodeLeWM transition batches.
- `codelewm.eval`: retrieval metrics, hard-negative pools, required baselines,
  action-view policy, collapse diagnostics, action ablation, surprise reports,
  and scorer-quality reports.
- `codelewm.harness`: package CLI entry point with `dataset build`, `dataset
  pack`, `train`, `eval retrieval`, `eval ablation`, `eval surprise`, `eval
  scorer-quality`, `index`, `score`, `rerank`, `manifest verify`, and
  `secret-scan`.
- `codelewm.observability` and `codelewm.security`: artifact manifests,
  structured logs, redaction, public license gates, checkpoint trust checks,
  non-execution guards, and secret scanning.

Current evidence:

- `scripts/first-results` runs the local build, pack, torch train, retrieval,
  surprise, index, manifest verification, report rendering, and secret scan
  loop. `docs/benchmark/FIRST_RESULTS.md` is smoke evidence only.
- The scaled HF Jobs run `codelewm-scaled-20260520-9699b53` completed on job
  `6a0d43c92dc5b1243da50bba` from source SHA
  `9699b5309e43a3278f272663ef60cda23040d92a`.
- Private HF artifacts were published to `abdelstark/codelewm-public-shard`,
  `abdelstark/codelewm-transition-model`, and `abdelstark/codelewm-runs`, then
  downloaded with `hf download` and verified locally.
- `docs/benchmark/SCALED_HF_RESULTS_2026-05-20.md`,
  `docs/cards/codelewm-scaled-dataset-2026-05-20.md`, and
  `docs/cards/codelewm-scaled-model-2026-05-20.md` are the artifact-backed
  record for that run.

Current blocker:

- The scaled pipeline is proven, but the first scaled checkpoint is not a
  positive action-conditioned quality result.
- Text-action beats random, shuffled-action, and lexical baselines, but loses
  to no-action on headline retrieval: Recall@1 `0.371` and MRR `0.472984`
  versus no-action Recall@1 `0.459` and MRR `0.546116`.
- Public model-quality claims remain blocked until a follow-up run passes an
  explicit action-use gate or the release is deliberately framed as a
  negative/diagnostic artifact.

Root `train.py`, root `eval.py`, and the Hydra configs are inherited from the
original image/LeWM seed. They are compatibility artifacts, not the source of
truth for CodeLeWM's code-edit training path.

## Required Reading

Before editing, read:

- `SPEC.md`
- the relevant file under `docs/spec/`
- the relevant RFC under `docs/rfcs/`
- `docs/roadmap/FULL_COMPLETION.md`
- `docs/roadmap/IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

If security, manifests, checkpoints, logs, licensing, candidate code, configs,
or reports are touched, also read `docs/spec/06-security.md` and
`docs/spec/05-observability.md`.

If Hugging Face Jobs, ml-intern, publication, downloaded-artifact validation, or
training recipes are touched, also read:

- `docs/operations/HF_ML_INTERN_TRAINING.md`
- `docs/training/SCALED_TRAINING_RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/roadmap/HF_ML_INTERN_GOAL_PROMPT.md`

## Work Rules

- One GitHub issue per branch and PR.
- Keep public docs direct and evidence-backed. Do not add unverifiable claims.
- Preserve schema versions unless the issue explicitly changes a public schema.
- Candidate code, source data, configs, and checkpoints are untrusted input.
- Do not import, execute, or test-run candidate code while parsing or scoring it.
- Keep optional training/data dependencies host-owned and explicitly grouped.
- Prefer explicit typed failures over silent row drops, silent clipping, or best
  effort artifact writes.
- Every published artifact must be schema-versioned, finite, JSON-native where
  applicable, checksum-verifiable, and secret-scanned.
- Do not print, commit, paste, or summarize Hugging Face token values. Treat
  `.env` as local secret state.

## Implementation Order

Use GitHub issues as the authoritative queue. The closed #109 through #122 and
#137 through #138 issues are completed evidence, not the next queue.

Current completion order:

1. #151 add no-action dominance diagnostics and claim gates.
2. #152 add action-discriminative shard diagnostics and hard negatives.
3. #153 add action-use objective and scaled sweep configs.
4. #154 run the follow-up HF Jobs action-use training, publication, download,
   inference, and eval cycle through the `hf` CLI.
5. #123 add package build and publishing gates.
6. #124 add dependency audit and provenance evidence.
7. #125 refresh public docs against the scaled evidence and claim boundary.
8. #126 run the final artifact freeze and release checklist.

Tracking issue #150 owns the action-conditioned scaled-result milestone.

## Validation

Current lightweight validation:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest tests/
uv run python -m compileall -q -x 'tests/fixtures/codestate/invalid_(before|after)\.py$' codelewm tests
uv run codelewm --help
```

HF Jobs orchestration must use the `hf` CLI for launch, monitoring, logs, stats,
download, and local verification:

```bash
hf auth whoami
CODELEWM_HF_JOBS_DRY_RUN=1 uv run scripts/hf-launch-codelewm-job
hf jobs inspect <job-id>
hf jobs logs <job-id>
hf jobs stats <job-id>
hf download ...
```

Do not mark the project complete unless the release-candidate artifacts can be
downloaded from Hugging Face, verified locally, and either pass the action-use
claim gate or explicitly document a negative/diagnostic claim boundary.
